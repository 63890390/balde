Static resources {#static-resources}
================

The static resources are handled using the GResource objects from GLib. You should write a XML file that describes all the resources used by your balde application, convert it to C source code using ``glib-compile-resources``, build it, and link it to your balde application binary.

Supposing that you have some files (``foo.js``, ``foo.css`` and ``asd/bola.txt``) inside of a ``static/`` directory, the following XML file can be used to generate the C source code:

@include static-resources.xml

You should read the [GLib documentation](https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/gio-GResource.html) to learn about how to use this XML with ``glib-compile-resources``.

The generated source will generate a C function, that returns the GResource object. The GResource object should be passed to the @ref balde_resources_load function, to register the resources to the balde application.

The following example demonstrates the usage of this feature:

@include hello-with-static.c

In this example the ``static_resources_get_resource`` function comes from the ``static-resources.h`` header, that was automatically generated by ``glib-compile-resources``.
